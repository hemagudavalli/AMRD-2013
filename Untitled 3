When the project is using Spring 4.3  and Hibernate 5.2,
how to write the JUnit test without bounded with concrete DB closely. 
In other words, How to mock DB in JUnit test for service method.  
If not possible give the reason else list cases for the different scenario.

Answer:

Implementation can be changed for test scope to a in-memory light weight DB. 
In test resources we have to use something like hsql as DB implementation in 
hibernate configuration. This will only be in test scope, actual package created will use
hibernate configuration for concrete DB. And hence we can mock the objects in Spring framework
for testing.

Example:
To establish a DB connection we assume using a JDBC template.
We can specify the driverManager class, database connection URL's in the templates.
So in our unit test we have to mock (@powermock annotation) our JDBC template.

//Assuming this question is theoretic.
